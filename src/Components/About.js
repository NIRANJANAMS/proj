        The main aim of DESWA is the development of a decentralized platform, built
on blockchain technology, to facilitate the connection between skilled workers and<br/>
potential clients. This innovative platform will ensure a secure, transparent, and
decentralized environment. Skilled workers will be able to create profiles, showcasing<br/>
their abilities and experience, and can optionally upload their certification from the
local governing authority. Clients will then be able to connect with these skilled<br/>
workers through the platform, enabling easy access to their services. This platform
offers a potential solution to the issues faced by skilled workers in the informal<br/>
economy, such as the lack of regulation, intermediaries, and fair labor practices.</p>
